# Free Code Camp Projects

This is a directory with my versions of Free Code Camp projects.

##### Please Note:
Free Code Camp has a requirement testing tool that is integrated into the
codepen links below. The tool may or may not be expanded in the top left
corner of the window. To expand tool, click on the hamburger menu in the
top left. The drop down menu might also not be calibrated for the correct
test. In each project I try to match to the testing tools names. Calibrate
the test to the project and click 'Run Tests' to see the results of each
challenge.
